##Feature Tasks

- Write a function that accepts a lengthy string parameter.
Without utilizing any of the built-in library methods available to your language, return the first word to occur more than once in that provided string.
Structure and Testing
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

- Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

###Method Description:
#### This function takes in a string of any length, and will return a string that is the most commonly occuring word in that string. this function will ignore punctuation following any word and is also case insensetive

###Time allotment:
- this function implementation took me about two hours to write and write tests for.

tests passing at time of submission.
